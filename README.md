## Election Audit Summary

This election analysis can be modified to be used on an election by adding a second winner if there are multiple winners in the election. This can be done by adding the top two candidates by vote percentage by adding an if <> lowest percentage statement.

Also, this could be modified to determine a winner of each county in an election, by determining the total votes or percentage of votes each candidate recieved in each individual county.
